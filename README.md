# BSecurite.CountIt


## Depending on more specific requirements, the following functionality could be added:
- which special characters can we expect in the input in order to filter these out
- how large can the input file be?
- which format for decimal numbers needs to be supported in order to correctly identify the end of sentence vs a decimal number (e.g 12,4. is a valid decimal number in the nl-NL culture, but not in en-EN)
- use a colored console for output or use Serilog for output
